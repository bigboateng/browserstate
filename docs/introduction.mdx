# üåê BrowserState

BrowserState is a powerful Node.js library for managing browser profiles across different storage providers, including local storage, Redis, AWS S3, and Google Cloud Storage.

## Why BrowserState?

Most browser automation workflows fail because authentication and session data don't persist reliably across environments. Manually handling cookies or re-authenticating slows everything down. Worse, many automations fail due to inconsistent browser fingerprints, machine IDs, and storage states‚Äîleading to bot detection and bans.

BrowserState ensures your automation behaves like a real, returning user by providing:

- **Full Browser Context Restoration** ‚Äì Save and restore cookies, local storage, IndexedDB, service worker caches, and extension data. Resume automation from the exact previous state.

- **Multi-Instance Synchronization** ‚Äì Share browser profiles across multiple servers or devices, making automation scalable and resilient.

- **Zero-Setup Onboarding for Automation** ‚Äì Instantly deploy automation-ready browser profiles without manual setup.

- **Efficient Resource Usage** ‚Äì Persistent browser usage without memory leaks, eliminating the need to launch new instances for every run.

## Installation

```bash
npm install browserstate
```

For specific storage providers, you may need additional dependencies. See the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide for details.
